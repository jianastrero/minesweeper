# Minesweeper
https://hyperskill.org/projects/8

### Why?
This was my first time to make a minesweeper, and first to use the proper way of making a state machine. Though, I'm not sure if I made the state machine right. This is a fun project, and it's actually not that hard.

Fun use of recursion for the exploration of mines.<br />
Rules are well explained.<br />
This project is perfect for a state machine, good for learning and implementing state machines.
